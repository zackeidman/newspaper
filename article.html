<h1>October 15, 2014 - The Giants Lose Victor Cruz for the Season</h1>
<img src="images/cruz1.png">
<p>PHILADELPHIA- The Giants left town without their star receiver, as Victor Cruz remained overnight in an area hospital after suffering a torn patella tendon, a devastating injury to his right knee that ends his season and Sunday night left his team shocked and saddened, a final indignity after suffering a 27-0 loss to the Eagles.</p>

<p>''That was heart-wrenching,'' veteran defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka said.</p>

<p>''Incredibly huge loss,'' Tom Coughlin said.</p>

<p>It was a hushed Giants locker room inside Lincoln Financial Field as teammates came to grips with the loss of not only the top receiver on the roster but also the most popular player on the team. When informed that the serious injury was a torn patella tendon, Kiwanuka shook his head.</p>

<p>''That's about as bad as it could be,'' he said.</p>

<p>With the Giants trailing 20-0 with 9:35 remaining in the third quarter, Eli Manning on fourth down on the Eagles' 3-yard line tried a lob pass to Cruz in the right corner of the end zone. Cruz had a step on cornerback Brandon Boykin and as he turned and pivoted while attempting to catch the ball, his right knee buckled. The ball glanced off Cruz's hands and he fell to the ground, in obvious pain. When it was clear he was in serious pain, his teammates gathered around him in the end zone and were joined by Eagles players, all on one knee.</p>

<p>Finally, Cruz was carted off the field and, in pain and distraught, he could not hold back. He buried his head in his gloved hands, weeping, as he was comforted on the cart by trainer Byron Hansen. As the cart drove slowly past the Giants sideline, players reached out to tap Cruz on the shoulder in what resembled a funeral procession.</p>

<p>Coughlin could not find the words to console Cruz.</p>

<p>''I was standing there with him but it was not a good situation,'' Coughlin said. ''It was not a good scene.''</p>

<p>Rookie Odell Beckham Jr., who will replace Cruz in the starting lineup, looked shocked afterward.</p>

<p>''To see him go down like that,'' Beckham said, ''it just touches your heart.''</p>

<p>Cruz signed a five-year, $43 million contract extension before last season. Without him, the Giants will have to rely heavily on Beckham, who missed the first four games dealing with a strained right hamstring. Cruz caught two passes for 16 yards Sunday night. Beckham in his second NFL game had two receptions for 28 yards.</p>

<p>Manning was unable to hide how saddened he was to lose his top target, a player who came up as an undrafted free agent and evolved into a star. A player, like Manning, who was elected a team captain.</p>

</p>''It was tough to say anything to him,'' Manning said. ''I patted him on the shoulder. He was in some pain. Anything I would have said, he wouldn't have heard me.''</p>
